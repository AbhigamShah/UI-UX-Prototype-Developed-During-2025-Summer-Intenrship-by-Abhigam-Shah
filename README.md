# UI/UX Prototype – 2025 Summer Internship Project SUP Module (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)

## Overview
This repository contains a front-end interaction prototype developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** during a previous internship. The prototype was created to examine **user workflows, interaction flow, and information organization** within a system-oriented interface.

The work focuses on evaluating **usability, task progression, and navigation clarity** at an early stage of development. Visual styling and backend integration were intentionally kept minimal to prioritize interaction behavior and layout decisions. All interactions are implemented using client-side logic and simulated data.

---

## Project Scope and Objectives
The primary objectives of this prototype were to:
- Understand how users interpret and navigate system interfaces  
- Evaluate task progression across multiple interaction states  
- Assess information hierarchy and content grouping  
- Identify usability issues before committing to full-scale development

## Page Descriptions and Interaction Roles

### `SUP_Module_Prototype_Updated.html`
This page serves as the primary entry point to the prototype and establishes the overall context of the module. It presents users with clearly defined navigation options and entry points into the system.

From an interaction perspective, this page was designed to support quick orientation by emphasizing clear affordances, logical grouping of actions, and minimal visual clutter. It helps users form an initial mental model of the system before proceeding to more detailed views.

---

### `SUP_Details_Tabular_View_Prototype.html`
This page presents information in a tabular format to support efficient scanning, comparison, and selection of multiple records. The layout explores how alignment, spacing, and column structure affect readability and decision-making efficiency.

Interactive elements are included to simulate realistic navigation behavior, allowing evaluation of how users move from an overview of multiple items to focused inspection of a specific entry.

---

### `SUP_Details_View_Only_Mode.html`
This page represents a read-only detailed view of a selected item. It is designed to present comprehensive information in a structured manner without introducing edit actions or unnecessary interactions.

The layout emphasizes content hierarchy and clear labeling to support focused review while minimizing cognitive load. This page allows users to inspect details confidently without the risk of accidental modification.

## User Flow
1. Users begin at the module interface, where available actions are introduced  
2. They navigate to a tabular view to review and compare multiple items  
3. A selected item is opened in a detailed, read-only view for focused inspection  

This sequence follows a standard **overview → compare → inspect** interaction pattern commonly used in enterprise and system-oriented interfaces.

---

## Technology Stack
- **HTML** for structural layout and semantic markup  
- **CSS** for layout control, spacing, and visual hierarchy  
- **JavaScript** for client-side interaction logic and state simulation  

---

## Notes
- Uses simulated (dummy) data only  
- No backend services, APIs, or production systems included  
- No proprietary or confidential information  
- Shared strictly for demonstration and evaluation purposes  

---

## Summary
This prototype demonstrates how early front-end prototyping can be used to evaluate usability, interaction flow, and information structure before full implementation. The project highlights the importance of aligning technical design decisions with user experience considerations in system-based applications.
